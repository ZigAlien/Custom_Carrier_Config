# Custom_Carrier_Config
Description:
App to apply a custom carrier configuration on a mobile phone.
Requires that the app's hash certificate is programmed on the sim card being used.
Based on Android Open Source Project Carrier Configuration: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/carrier

About the project:
I created this app as part of my summer internship at CACI/LGS labs. 
This app was a culmination of my research on the workings of carrier configuration and APK structure in mobile phone firmware.
Previously, in order to change the carrier configuration, the phone had to be rooted so that edits could be applied to the configuration file.
This app allows carrier configurations to be changed easily and automatically without rooting the phone, making mobile testing easier and faster.
